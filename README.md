# Lattice: Java API for Simulating Geometric Shapes

Welcome to Lattice, a Java based API for simulating geometric shapes in a virtual world. This repository includes programs that showcase the simulation of rotating and translating tetrahedrons, cubes, planet revolutions, and falling and bouncing spheres. These simulations provide a comprehensive understanding of how objects interact with the virtual environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have BlueJ IDE installed on your machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maazmalik2004/Lattice.git
```

Open BlueJ and open the project by selecting the project's root folder.

Usage
Running the Simulations
Open BlueJ and load the project.
Navigate to the Lattice package.
Open the desired master program (e.g., rotatingTranslatingTetrahedron, rotatingTranslatingCube, PlanetRevolution, bouncingBall).
Right-click on the program class and select "void main(String[] args)" to execute the simulation.
Customizing Simulations
Explore and modify the master programs in BlueJ to customize simulations according to your requirements. Adjust parameters, such as world dimensions, object properties, and motion patterns, to create unique simulations.

Program Descriptions
Rotating and Translating Tetrahedron
Simulates the rotation and translation of a tetrahedron in a virtual world. The program showcases movements around X, Y, and Z axes.

Rotating and Translating Cube
Simulates the rotation and translation of a cube in a virtual world. The program demonstrates movements around X, Y, and Z axes.

Planet Revolution Simulation
Simulates the revolution of a star, planet, moon, and a space shuttle in a virtual world. Gravity effects on the space shuttle are also simulated.

Bouncing Ball
Simulates the motion of a falling and bouncing sphere in a virtual world. Gravity influences the motion, and the sphere bounces upon reaching the ground.

Virtual World Class
The virtualworld class manages the virtual world, including world dimensions, cameras, and object rendering. It provides methods for loading objects, resetting displays, and printing world descriptions.

Object Class
The object class represents geometric shapes and includes methods for creating cubes, cuboids, tetrahedrons, spheres, and more. It supports rotations, translations, and gravity simulations.

Running in BlueJ
These programs are designed to run in the BlueJ IDE. Follow the instructions above to execute the simulations within the BlueJ environment.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the code or add new features. See the Contributing Guidelines for more details.
